# Technology

This chapter explains the features and technical characteristics of BEAR.Sunday.

## Dependency Injection (DI)

> "Objects are injected from the interface, just as sun ray is injected when a window is opened."

Dependency Injection (DI) is a pattern that automatically resolves object creation and dependencies by the framework, lowering code coupling and improving testability and maintainability. BEAR.Sunday's DI uses [Ray.Di](https://github.com/ray-di/Ray.Di), an independent package that incorporates the design philosophy of Google's DI framework Guice and covers almost all of its features.

What sets this framework's DI apart from other frameworks is that autowiring, which resolves dependencies based on rules without the user directly touching the container, is the default. Other features are as follows:

* Context-dependent bindings change the application's behavior at compile time.
* Attribute-based configuration enhances code self-description.
* Qualifiers used to bind different implementations to the same interface also enhance code self-description.
* Ray.Di resolves dependencies at compile time, improving runtime performance. This differs from other DI containers that resolve dependencies at runtime.
* Object dependencies can be visualized in a graph.
* In addition to link bindings and instance bindings, various other bindings are supported, such as attribute bindings, untarget bindings, multi-bindings, constructor bindings, context bindings, and Null bindings.
* Provider bindings are also possible for lazy binding.
* Bindings can be grouped into modules, improving reusability.

## Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP)

> "Aspects wrap your objects, like a gift wrap enhances a present."

Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) is a pattern that separates core concerns such as business logic from cross-cutting concerns such as logging and caching, enabling flexible applications. BEAR.Sunday's AOP uses Ray.Aop, an independent package, and declaratively binds cross-cutting processing by attaching PHP attributes to classes and methods.

AOP is one of the most misunderstood technologies. Its purpose is not to violate constraints and break order, but to complement areas where object orientation struggles, such as exploratory feature assignment and separation of cross-cutting processing, and to create application-wide constraints, i.e., it is one of the paradigms that can be designed as constraints of an application framework.

Other features of AOP are as follows:

* Cross-cutting processing can be bound to classes and methods that match search criteria such as class and method names.
* By using PHP attributes, cross-cutting processing can be described declaratively.
* Classes and methods that match search criteria can be dynamically changed.

## Resource Oriented Architecture (ROA)

> "Resources interconnected, like the web of life that binds all creatures."

BEAR.Sunday's ROA is an architecture for realizing RESTful APIs in the internal structure of web applications and is at the core of BEAR.Sunday's design principles. It is a hypermedia framework and also an object as a service. Like the Web, all data and functions are treated as resources and operated with specified interfaces such as GET/POST/PUT/DELETE. Resources are also interconnected. By providing hyperlinks to other resources, resources can provide not only information and functionality but also affordances.

### Uniform Interface

Access to resources is done using HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). These methods specify the operations that can be performed on resources and provide a common interface regardless of the type of resource.

- GET: Retrieve the current state of a resource
- POST: Perform non-idempotent operations on a resource (such as creation)
- PUT: Perform idempotent operations on a resource (such as creation or update)
- DELETE: Delete a resource

### Hypermedia

Links between resources are represented by hypermedia. The representation of each resource includes links, and clients can navigate within the application by following these links. This lowers the coupling between client and server and increases the flexibility of the application. Content can also be represented in a tree structure by linking internally.

### Separation of Value and Representation

In BEAR.Sunday's ROA, the value and representation of resources are clearly separated. The value of a resource is managed by the application's domain logic, and the representation is for representing that value in various formats (JSON, XML, HTML, etc.). This separation makes domain logic and presentation logic loosely coupled, improving the maintainability and extensibility of the application.

### Page Resources and App Resources

In BEAR.Sunday's ROA, resources are classified into page resources and app resources.

- Page Resources: Resources that mainly represent HTML and are intended to be accessed from a web browser. They are resources that make up the user interface.
- App Resources: Resources that make up the backend of the application and mainly represent JSON or XML. They are intended to be accessed by other applications or services.

By separating page resources and app resources, the user interface and application logic can be developed and deployed independently. Also, by reusing app resources, a consistent backend can be provided to multiple user interfaces (web browsers, mobile apps, other services, etc.).

By using BEAR.Sunday's ROA, scalable and loosely coupled applications that align with Web design principles can be built. Separating value and representation allows domain logic and presentation logic to be developed and tested independently, improving application quality and development efficiency. Also, separating page resources and app resources allows user interfaces and application logic to be developed and deployed independently, improving application flexibility and extensibility. Hyperlinks also clarify relationships between resources, keep coupling between client and server low, and enhance resource self-description and API discoverability.

### Differences from MVC

BEAR.Sunday's ROA takes a different approach compared to the traditional MVC architecture. MVC structures an application with three components: Model, View, and Controller. In practice, however, the Controller freely manipulates the Model and View at runtime, literally controlling everything.

In contrast, with BEAR.Sunday, the View is injected into the Resource object, and the Resource is unaware of the View, just as the View is unaware of the Resource. The Resource object does not manipulate the injected View and does not even know what kind of View has been injected. Only when the Resource object is evaluated as a string does the injected View render the Resource's state into a string representation. In this way, the Resource and View are loosely coupled, and their responsibilities are clearly separated.

Furthermore, unlike the unconstrained relationship between Controller and Model, Resources have constraints on including other Resources, which can be done declaratively. The Resource also depends on different Resources, forming a tree structure similar to DI dependencies. Other differences include:

* BEAR.Sunday Resources provide possible operations (affordances) by declaring relationships. Clients can dynamically manipulate Resources using this as a clue. It is self-descriptive.
  HAL (Hypertext Application Language) is adopted for links, standardizing the links between Resources.
* Unlike MVC Models, Resources can be directly called from various clients, including the console.
* There is no need to build HTML sites and API sites separately; the same Resources can be used to build both HTML sites and API sites simultaneously.

## Event-Driven Content Strategy Based on ROA by Integration with Modern CDN

> "No volatility, just what users truly desire."

BEAR.Sunday realizes an advanced event-driven caching strategy by integrating with instant-purgeable CDNs such as Fastly, with Resource Oriented Architecture (ROA) at its core. This strategy invalidates CDN and server-side caches, as well as ETags (Entity Tags), immediately in response to resource state change events, rather than invalidating caches based on traditional TTL (Time to Live).

This approach, which eliminates volatility, not only avoids SPOF (Single Point of Failure) and achieves high availability and fault tolerance but also maximizes user experience and cost efficiency, realizing the Web's original distributed caching for dynamic content just like static content. In other words, it re-realizes the scalable and network-cost-reducing principle of distributed caching that the Web has had since the 1990s using modern technology.

### Cache Invalidation by Semantic Methods
In BEAR.Sunday's ROA, each resource operation is given semantics (a semantic role). For example, the GET method retrieves a resource, and the PUT method updates a resource. These methods work together in an event-driven manner and efficiently invalidate related caches. For instance, when a specific resource is updated, the change automatically propagates to other resources that depend on it, and related caches are invalidated. This maintains data consistency and freshness, providing users with the latest information.

### Visualization of Dependencies through Embedded Links
In ROA design, resources can include links to other resources, transparently showing resource dependencies to clients. By utilizing this link information, when cache invalidation is needed, it can be instantly determined which resources are affected, enabling efficient cache management.

### Cache Key Generation by Argument Declaration
In BEAR.Sunday, resource method arguments are explicitly declared. This allows for generating unique cache keys based on resource state or request parameters. Cache key generation is an important mechanism for accurately identifying and invalidating specific caches when a resource's state changes. This avoids unnecessary cache deletion while quickly updating only the necessary parts.

### Identity Verification and Quick Response with ETag
By setting ETags before the system boots, content identity can be quickly verified, and if there are no changes, a 304 Not Modified response is returned. This is an effective technique for reducing network load and improving user experience.

### Partial Updates with Donut Caching and ESI
BEAR.Sunday adopts a donut caching strategy and uses Edge Side Includes (ESI) to enable partial content updates at the CDN edge. This technology allows for dynamically updating only the necessary parts without recaching the entire page, significantly improving performance and caching efficiency.

Thus, BEAR.Sunday's integration with Fastly and ROA-based caching strategy not only realizes advanced distributed caching but also enhances application performance and improves fault tolerance. This allows users to experience consistent responsiveness and data consistency under any circumstances.

## Ease of Testing

* Each resource is independent, and due to the stateless request nature of REST, testing is easy.
* Since resource state and representation are separated, only the resource state can be tested.
* API testing can be performed by following hypermedia links, and testing can be done with the same code in PHP and HTTP.

## Resource Validation

Resource representation is validated using JsonSchema to maintain resource consistency. Using standard schemas for validation allows for the use of external tools.

## Stream Output
* By streaming resource representation, large-scale content that cannot be handled in memory can be output.
* Streams can be mixed with normal value assignments.

## Visualization and Debugging

* During development, resource scopes and tools are graphically displayed on HTML.
* Resource state can be checked on the web screen, and PHP code and HTML templates can be edited online and reflected in real-time.

## Startup Acceleration

* Pre-compilation generates PHP code for dependency generation to achieve minimal bootstrapping.
* In an ideal DI world, instances are generated only once at startup. This is called the root object, and by caching this root object, initialization is reused to speed up application startup.

## Integration of PHP Interfaces and SQL Execution
In BEAR.Sunday, managing the execution of SQL statements for interacting with the database is made easy by using PHP interfaces. It is possible to directly bind SQL execution objects to interfaces without implementing classes. This improves code reusability and enhances modularity.

### Evaluation of Query Arguments
BEAR.Sunday interfaces can accept not only scalar values but also objects. In particular, how objects are evaluated by the interface is important. For example, when a DateTimeInterface object is passed to an interface, it is automatically evaluated appropriately as a date within the SQL statement. This allows for efficient handling of date and time data.

### Dependency Injection of Query Arguments
In BEAR.Sunday, it is also possible to inject dependencies into interfaces. This allows for dynamically supplying necessary objects and values to interfaces, enabling more flexible application design. By using dependency injection, code testing becomes easier, and low coupling can be maintained while achieving high cohesion.

### AI and Tool-Assisted SQL Generation and Optimization
In BEAR.Sunday, it is also possible to inject dependencies into interfaces. This allows for dynamically supplying necessary objects and values to interfaces, enabling more flexible application design. By using dependency injection, code testing becomes easier, and low coupling can be maintained while achieving high cohesion.

### Overall Debugging and Maintenance Convenience
Direct management of SQL makes debugging easier when errors occur. The behavior of SQL queries can be directly observed, allowing for quick identification and correction of problems. Also, since query modifications and feature extensions can be made directly, application maintenance and evolution proceed smoothly.

* By preparing PHP interfaces and SQL, SQL execution objects can be bound to PHP interfaces without implementing classes.
* PHP interfaces can specify not only scalar values but also objects to be evaluated as strings. For example, specifying DateTimeInterface will evaluate it as an SQL date.
* Dependencies can be injected as arguments into PHP interfaces.

## API Documentation Generation

API documentation is automatically generated from code. This maintains consistency between code and documentation and improves maintainability.

## Integration with Other Systems

* Integration with console applications allows for accessing from both web and command line without changing source code.
* Different applications can be executed concurrently within the same PHP runtime, and all resources can be accessed from an HTTP client.
* Local and remote BEAR.Sunday applications can be handled similarly, and BEAR.Thrift allows for integration with applications in other languages.

## Standards Compliance

* JSON format and www-form format are supported by default, and resource requests are interpreted according to the content type.
* Semantic versioning is adopted to maintain backward compatibility.
* Errors are returned in the `vnd.error+json` media type format by default, including detailed error messages.
* ETags are used to invalidate caches when a resource's state changes.
* When caching, in addition to the `Cache-Control` HTTP header, HTTP headers such as `Ages`, `Last-Modified`, and `ETag` are added.

## Object-Oriented Principles

BEAR.Sunday emphasizes object-oriented principles to make applications maintainable in the long term.

### Composition over Inheritance

Composition is recommended over inheritance classes. In general, directly calling parent class methods from child classes can potentially increase coupling between classes. From a design perspective, the only abstract class that requires inheritance at runtime is the `BEAR\Resource\ResourceObject` resource class, but its methods exist only to be used by other classes. In BEAR.Sunday, there is no class where the user calls methods of an inherited framework parent class at runtime.

### Everything Is Injected

Framework classes do not reference "configuration files" or "debug constants" at runtime to determine behavior. Dependencies corresponding to behavior are injected. This means that to change the application's behavior, there is no need to change code; only the binding of the implementation of dependencies to the interface needs to be changed. APP_DEBUG or APP_MODE constants do not exist. There is no way to know which mode the software is running in after it starts, nor is there a need to know.

### Root Object

In the world of DI, users avoid directly dealing with the injector (DI container) as much as possible. Instead, a single root object is generated at the application's entry point to start the application. In BEAR.Sunday's DI, there is virtually no operation of the DI container even at configuration time. The root object is large but a single variable, so it is reused across requests to realize an extremely optimized bootstrap.

## Non-Destructive Backward Compatibility

BEAR.Sunday is designed with a focus on maintaining backward compatibility in the evolution of software. In modern software development, frequent breaking of backward compatibility and the associated burden of modifications and testing have become issues, but BEAR.Sunday aims to avoid this problem and has been successful.

This does not mean stopping the evolution of software. The Web has been changing for decades, but its core has remained unchanged, and backward compatibility has been maintained. BEAR.Sunday was designed to apply this spirit of the Web to application frameworks as well.

BEAR.Sunday adopts semantic versioning to prevent the addition of new features or changes to existing features from affecting existing code. Deprecated code is given the "deprecated" attribute but is not removed and does not affect the behavior of existing code. Instead, new features are added, and evolution continues.

In fact, many features have been added since the release of BEAR.Sunday in the PHP 5.4 era, but existing applications continue to function without modification. Furthermore, with the utilization of static analysis tools that have come with the evolution of the PHP ecosystem, the code has become cleaner and faster.

This design, which makes backward compatibility an absolute imperative, and the approach using semantic versioning enable this long-term compatibility. This allows developers to adopt BEAR.Sunday with confidence and benefit from the evolving ecosystem.

## Code Quality

To provide high-quality code applications, the BEAR.Sunday framework itself maintains a high standard of code quality.

* The framework's code applies both the static analysis tools psalm and phpstan at the maximum level.
* 100% test coverage is maintained.
* Type coverage is also nearly 100%. The use of mixed is minimized.
* It is principally an immutable system and is so clean that initialization is not required every time even in tests. It brings out the power of PHP's asynchronous communication engines like Swoole.
