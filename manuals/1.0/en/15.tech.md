# Technology

This chapter explains the features and technical characteristics of BEAR.Sunday.

## Resource Oriented Architecture (ROA)

> "Resources interconnected, like the web of life that binds all creatures."

BEAR.Sunday's ROA is an architecture that realizes RESTful APIs within a web application. This is the core of BEAR.Sunday's design principles and serves as both a hypermedia framework and "Object as a Service". As with the Web, all data and functions are treated as resources and are manipulated through standardized interfaces such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

### URI

URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) are a key element to the success of the Web and are at the core of BEAR.Sunday's ROA. By assigning URIs to all resources handled by the application, resources can be easily identified and accessed. URIs not only function as identifiers for resources but are also used to express relationships between resources. This makes it easy to manipulate, reuse, and combine resources.

### Uniform Interface

Access to resources is done using HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). These methods define the operations that can be performed on resources and provide a common interface regardless of the type of resource.

- GET: Retrieves the current state of a resource
- POST: Performs a non-idempotent operation on a resource (e.g., creation)
- PUT: Performs an idempotent operation on a resource (e.g., creation or update)
- DELETE: Deletes a resource

## Hypermedia

In BEAR.Sunday's ROA, each resource provides affordances (operations and functions available to the client) through hyperlinks. These links represent the operations available to the client and instruct how to navigate within the application. This reduces coupling between client and server and enhances the flexibility and expandability of the application.

Hyperlinks not only indicate relationships between resources but also function as a mechanism for embedding resources. This is similar to how images are embedded using the IMG tag in HTML. In BEAR.Sunday, resources are accessible as independent entities, and the content tree structure is formed by declaratively building relationships between resources through internal links.

BEAR.Sunday's hypermedia approach is a design that follows Web principles and enhances the flexibility and expandability of applications.

### Separation of Value and Representation

In BEAR.Sunday's ROA, the value and representation of resources are clearly separated. The value of a resource is managed by the application's domain logic, while the representation is for expressing that value in various formats (e.g., JSON, XML, HTML). This separation results in loose coupling between domain logic and presentation logic, improving the maintainability and expandability of the application.

### Page Resources and App Resources

In BEAR.Sunday's ROA, resources are classified into two types: page resources and app resources.

- Page Resources: Mainly resources with HTML representation, intended to be accessed from a web browser. They constitute the user interface resources.
- App Resources: Resources that make up the application's backend, mainly with JSON or XML representation. They are intended to be accessed by other applications or services.

By separating page resources and app resources, the user interface and application logic can be developed and deployed independently. Also, by reusing app resources, a consistent backend can be provided to multiple user interfaces (web browsers, mobile apps, other services, etc.).

Using BEAR.Sunday's ROA, scalable and loosely coupled applications that follow Web design principles can be built. The separation of value and representation allows domain logic and presentation logic to be developed and tested independently, improving application quality and development efficiency. Also, separating page resources and app resources allows user interfaces and application logic to be developed and deployed independently, enhancing the flexibility and expandability of the application. Hyperlinks also make the relationships between resources explicit, keeping coupling between client and server low and enhancing the self-descriptive nature of resources and the discoverability of APIs.

### Differences from MVC

BEAR.Sunday's ROA takes a different approach from the conventional MVC architecture. MVC composes an application with three components: model, view, and controller, but in reality, the controller freely manipulates the model and view at runtime, and the controller literally controls everything.

In contrast, in BEAR.Sunday, a view is injected into the resource object. The resource is unaware of the view, and at the same time, the view is also unaware of the resource. The resource object does not perform any operations on the injected view and does not even know what kind of view was injected. While resource methods are only concerned with the resource state, the injected resource view only renders the resource state into a string representation when the resource object is string evaluated. In this way, resources and views are loosely coupled, and their responsibilities are clearly separated.

Also, in contrast to the unconstrained relationship between controller and model, resources have a constraint on containing other resources using URIs, and this can be done declaratively. That resource again depends on different resources, forming a tree structure like dependencies in DI. Other differences include:

- BEAR.Sunday resources provide possible operations (affordances) by declaring relations, making them self-descriptive.
- HAL (Hypertext Application Language) is adopted to standardize links between resources.
- Unlike MVC models, resources can be called directly from various clients including the console.
- There is no need to build HTML sites and API sites separately; HTML sites and API sites can be built simultaneously using the same resources.

## Dependency Injection (DI)

> "Objects are injected from the interface, just as sun ray is injected when a window is opened."

Dependency Injection (DI) is an important technique for enhancing the design and structure of applications in object-oriented programming. The central purpose of DI is to divide an application's functionality into multiple components with independent domains or roles and manage the dependencies between them.

DI helps horizontally divide a single function into multiple functions. The divided functions can be independently developed and tested as "dependencies". Based on the single responsibility principle, injecting those dependencies with clear responsibilities and roles from the outside improves object reusability and testability. Dependencies are also divided vertically into other dependencies, forming a dependency tree. This dependency tree is called an object graph, and the main role of DI is to become the builder of this object graph.

Using DI improves the structure of the application and loosens the coupling between components. This helps adhere to many of the best practices in object-oriented programming, resulting in code that is easier to manage and testable. However, these are merely secondary benefits, and the main purpose of DI is to design and build loosely coupled applications following the principle of "divide and conquer".

BEAR.Sunday's DI uses an independent package called [Ray.Di](https://github.com/ray-di/Ray.Di), which incorporates the design philosophy of Google's DI framework Guice and covers almost all of its features.

### Binding by Context

For example, consider an application with two contexts, HTML and PROD, on top of the base application. In the HTML context, the binding for resource representation changes from JSON view to HTML view. In PROD, the cache interface bound to Array cache is bound to Redis cache. By overlaying bindings from multiple contexts, the application code can behave differently without any changes.

Instead of using IF statements to check if it's in DEBUG mode and change behavior at runtime, dependencies with different implementations are bound according to the context.

Other features include:

* Attribute-based configuration enhances code self-descriptiveness.
* Using qualifiers to bind different implementations to the same interface also enhances code self-descriptiveness.
* Ray.Di resolves dependencies at compile time, improving runtime performance. This is different from other DI containers that resolve dependencies at runtime.
* Object dependencies can be visualized in a graph. ex) [application skeleton](/images/app.svg)
* In addition to link binding, instance binding, and others, various bindings are supported such as attribute binding, untarget binding, multi-binding, construct binding, context binding, and Null binding.
* Dependencies with high instantiation costs can be lazily bound to obtain instances at runtime.
* Bindings can be grouped into modules for reuse.

## Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP)

> "Aspects wrap your objects, like a gift wrap enhances a present."

Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) is a pattern that realizes flexible applications by separating core concerns such as business logic from cross-cutting concerns such as logging and caching. Cross-cutting concerns refer to functionalities or processes that span across multiple modules or layers.

BEAR.Sunday's AOP uses an independent package called Ray.Aop and declaratively binds cross-cutting processes by attaching PHP attributes to classes or methods. Ray.Aop conforms to Java's [AOP Alliance](https://aopalliance.sourceforge.net/) and has the following features:

* The declarative description method using attributes improves code readability.
* Cross-cutting processes can be bound based on search conditions, allowing for flexible configurations based on context.

AOP is one of the most misunderstood technologies. Its purpose is not to ignore constraints and disrupt order for the sake of powerful capabilities, but rather to complement areas where object-orientation is not adept, such as exploratory feature allocation and separation of cross-cutting processes. In other words, it is one of the paradigms that makes it possible to create application-wide constraints, that is, to design as application framework constraints.

## Event-Driven Content Strategy Based on ROA with Integration of Modern CDN

> "No volatility, just what users truly desire."

BEAR.Sunday realizes an advanced event-driven caching strategy by integrating with instant purge-capable CDNs such as Fastly, with ROA at its core. Instead of invalidating caches based on conventional TTL (Time to Live), this strategy immediately invalidates the CDN cache, server-side cache, and ETag (Entity Tag) based on resource state change events.

This approach that eliminates volatility not only avoids SPOF (Single Point of Failure) and achieves high availability and fault tolerance but also maximizes user experience and cost efficiency. It realizes the Web's original distributed caching that scales and reduces network costs even for dynamic content, just like static content. In other words, it re-implements the principle of distributed caching that the Web has had since the 1990s using modern technologies.

### Cache Invalidation by Semantic Methods
In BEAR.Sunday's ROA, each resource operation is given a semantic role. For example, the GET method retrieves a resource, while the PUT method updates a resource. These methods work together in an event-driven manner and efficiently invalidate related caches. For instance, when a specific resource is updated, that change automatically propagates to other resources that depend on it, and related caches are invalidated. This maintains data consistency and freshness, providing users with the latest information.

### Visualizing Dependencies through Embedded Links
In ROA design, resources can contain links to other resources, transparently showing resource dependencies to the client. By utilizing this link information, it can be instantly determined which resources are affected when cache invalidation is necessary, enabling efficient cache management.

### Cache Key Generation by Argument Declaration
In BEAR.Sunday, resource method arguments are clearly declared. This allows generating custom cache keys based on the resource state or request parameters. Cache key generation is an important mechanism for accurately identifying specific caches when the resource state changes and invalidating them. This allows avoiding unnecessary cache deletion while quickly updating only the necessary parts.

### Quick Response and Identity Confirmation with ETag
By setting the ETag before the system boots, the identity of the content can be quickly verified, and a 304 Not Modified response is returned if there are no changes. This is an effective technique for reducing network load and improving user experience.

### Partial Updates with Donut Hole Caching and ESI
BEAR.Sunday adopts the donut hole caching strategy and uses Edge Side Includes (ESI) to enable partial content updates at the CDN edge. This technology allows dynamically updating only the necessary parts without re-caching the entire page, significantly improving performance and caching efficiency.

In this way, BEAR.Sunday's ROA-based caching strategy integrated with Fastly not only realizes advanced distributed caching but also enhances application performance and fault tolerance. This allows users to experience consistent responsiveness and data integrity under any circumstances.

## Ease of Testing

BEAR.Sunday allows for easy and effective testing due to the following design characteristics:

* Each resource is independent, and testing is easy due to the nature of stateless requests in REST.
* Since the state and representation of resources are separated, it is possible to test the state of resources even when the representation is HTML.
* API testing can be done by following hypermedia links, using the same code in PHP and HTTP.
* Context-based binding allows binding different implementations during testing. Bindings can be changed for the entire "test context" or temporarily for a specific test.
* The ResourceObject includes `header` meta-information, allowing for testing based on meta-information. For example, if the content is cached, the presence of caching can be tested by checking the `Age` header. Compare this with MVC models.
* Resources embedded with `#[Embed]` embed resource requests, not values. The intention of what kind of resource to embed can be tested.

## Resource Validation

JsonSchema is used to validate resource representations and maintain resource consistency. Using standard schemas for validation enables the use of external tools.

## Stream Output
* Streaming output of resource representations allows outputting large-scale content that cannot be handled in memory.
* Streams can coexist with normal value assignments.

## Visualization and Debugging

* During development, the scope and tools of resources are graphically displayed on HTML.
* The state of resources can be checked on the web page, and PHP code and HTML templates can be edited online and reflected in real-time.

## Startup Acceleration

* Pre-compilation generates PHP code for dependency generation, achieving minimal bootstrapping.
* In an ideal DI world, instances are generated only once at startup. This is called the root object, and by caching this root object, initialization can be reused to accelerate application startup.

## Integration of PHP Interfaces and SQL Execution
In BEAR.Sunday, SQL statements for interacting with the database can be easily managed using PHP interfaces. It is possible to bind SQL execution objects directly to interfaces without implementing classes. This improves code reusability and enhances modularity.

### Evaluation of Query Arguments
BEAR.Sunday interfaces can accept not only scalar values but also objects. In particular, how objects are evaluated by the interface is important. For example, when a DateTimeInterface object is passed to an interface, it is automatically evaluated appropriately as a date within the SQL statement. This allows efficient handling of date and time data.

### Dependency Injection of Query Arguments
In BEAR.Sunday, it is also possible to inject dependencies into interfaces. This allows dynamically supplying necessary objects and values to interfaces, enabling more flexible application design. Using dependency injection makes code testing easier and maintains low coupling while maintaining high cohesion.

### SQL Generation and Optimization Using AI and Tools
In BEAR.Sunday, it is also possible to inject dependencies into interfaces. This allows dynamically supplying necessary objects and values to interfaces, enabling more flexible application design. Using dependency injection makes code testing easier and maintains low coupling while maintaining high cohesion.

### Comprehensive Debugging and Maintenance Convenience
Direct management of SQL makes debugging easier when errors occur. The behavior of SQL queries can be directly observed, allowing for quick identification and correction of issues. Also, since queries can be modified and functionalities can be expanded directly, application maintenance and evolution proceed smoothly.

* PHP interfaces and SQL can be prepared, and SQL execution objects can be bound to PHP interfaces without implementing classes.
* PHP interfaces can specify not only scalar values but also objects to be evaluated as strings. For example, specifying DateTimeInterface will evaluate it as a date in SQL.
* Dependencies can be injected as arguments into PHP interfaces.

## API Documentation Generation

API documentation is automatically generated from code. This maintains consistency between code and documentation and improves maintainability.

## Integration with Other Systems

* Integration with console applications allows access from both the web and command line without changing the source code.
* Different applications can be executed concurrently within the same PHP runtime, allowing access to all resources from an HTTP client.
* Local and remote BEAR.Sunday applications can be handled similarly, and BEAR.Thrift allows integration with applications in other languages.

## Standards Compliance

* JSON format and www-form format are supported by default, and resource requests are interpreted according to the content type.
* Semantic versioning is adopted to maintain backward compatibility.
* By default, errors are returned in the `vnd.error+json` media type format, returning error messages including error details.
* ETag is used to invalidate caches when the resource state changes.
* When caching, HTTP headers such as `Cache-Control`, `Ages`, `Last-Modified`, and `ETag` are added in addition to the `Cache-Control` header.

## Object-Oriented Principles

BEAR.Sunday emphasizes object-oriented principles to make applications maintainable in the long term.

### Composition over Inheritance

Composition is recommended over inheritance classes. In general, directly calling methods of the parent class from the child class may increase coupling between classes. The only abstract class that requires inheritance at runtime from a design perspective is `BEAR\Resource\ResourceObject`, the resource class, but this also exists solely for other classes to use ResourceObject methods. In BEAR.Sunday, there is no class where the user calls methods of an inherited framework parent class at runtime.

### Everything is Injected

Framework classes do not refer to "configuration files" or "debug constants" at runtime to determine behavior. Dependencies corresponding to behavior are injected. This means that to change the behavior of the application, you don't need to change the code, but only change the binding of the implementation to the interface for dependencies. APP_DEBUG or APP_MODE constants do not exist. There is no way to know which mode the software is currently running in after it starts, and there is no need to know.

### Root Object

In the original DI world, users avoid directly handling the injector (DI container) as much as possible. Instead, a single root object is created at the application's entry point to start the application. In BEAR.Sunday's DI, there is essentially no DI container manipulation even at configuration time. The root object is huge but is a single variable, so it is reused beyond requests to realize a highly optimized bootstrap.

## Non-Destructive Backward Compatibility

BEAR.Sunday is designed with an emphasis on maintaining backward compatibility in the evolution of software. In modern software development, frequent breakage of backward compatibility and the resulting burden of modifications and testing have become a challenge, but BEAR.Sunday aims to avoid this problem and has been successful.

This doesn't mean stopping the evolution of software. The Web has been changing for decades, but its core has remained unchanged and backward compatibility has been maintained. BEAR.Sunday is designed to apply this spirit of the Web to application frameworks as well.

BEAR.Sunday adopts semantic versioning to prevent new feature additions and changes to existing features from affecting existing code. Deprecated code is given the "deprecated" attribute but is never deleted and does not affect the behavior of existing code. Instead, new features are added and evolution continues.

In fact, since its release in PHP 5.4, many features have been added to BEAR.Sunday, but existing applications continue to function without modification. Furthermore, with the utilization of static analysis tools and other advancements in the PHP ecosystem, the code has become cleaner and faster.

The design that makes backward compatibility an absolute proposition and the approach of semantic versioning enable this long-term compatibility. This allows developers to confidently adopt BEAR.Sunday and benefit from the evolving ecosystem.

## Code Quality

To deliver high-quality applications, the BEAR.Sunday framework itself maintains a high standard of code quality.

* The framework code applies the maximum level of both psalm and phpstan static analysis tools.
* 100% test coverage is maintained.
* Type coverage is also nearly 100%. The use of mixed types is minimized.
* It is fundamentally an immutable system and is so clean that re-initialization is unnecessary even in tests. It unleashes the power of PHP's asynchronous communication engines like Swoole.
