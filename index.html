            <h2>Resource Orientated Framework </h2>
            <p class="framework">In BEAR.Sunday 'everything' is a REST resource which leads to far simpler design and extensibility. Interactions with your database, services and even pages and sections of your app all sit comfortably in a resource which can be consumed or rendered at will. </p>

            <h2>Injected Dependency Framework</h2>
            <p class="framework">In BEAR.Sunday DI is not just a bolt on or handy tool. Everything you code in your application is coded against an interface or abstract class, this means that you are never creating a hard dependency on libraries or components that might change in the future.

            <h2>Aspect Wrapped Framework </h2>
            <p class="framework">In BEAR.Sunday we recognize that crucial flexibility per request is key to web applications.
                With AOP included in BEAR, testable aspects that are not part of your business logic, can wrap your core concerns without them even knowing about it.

                <span id="moreAop" class="collapse" data-target="#demo">
                This means you can write clean domain logic without cluttering it with the likes of caching, logging and authentication code. These will instead be applied elegantly. </p>

            <p class="lead">BEAR.Sunday offers no libraries of its own. PHP namespaces, PSR, a new github coding culture, unit testing, a new trend of library oriented frameworks...  all push us to a more library oriented way of thinking. So BEAR.Sunday chooses not to have itâ€™s own components, it uses others from Aura, Symfony, Doctrine and Zend framework etc.</p>

            <p class="lead">DI removes coupling between application objects, while AOP decouples application concerns. BEAR.Sunday is an abstraction framework. <i>DSL, Annotation, URI, Interface, Aspects and Hypermedia.</i> These abstraction technologies encourage intentional-oriented code.</p>

            <p class="lead">BEAR.Sunday has a unique runtime that doesn't repeat the same procedure again and again.

                The whole application is created into a single object graph that can be serialized and stored in memory. This application graph is not recreated on each request. All dependencies are injected and initialized only upon creation, then is re-used on each lean request.</p>
